TABLES

When creating tables, the general structure will look like this:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dates</th>
        <th>Work</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2018 - 2021</td>
      <td>Arrow Electronics</td>
    </tr>
      <td>2021 - 2022</td>
      <td>Zayo Group</td>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
      
    </tfoot>

  </table>

it starts with <table> which designates that the data code & data will go there
tables headers and individual rows are then added one at a time
<thead> designating that this row will be for the table's headers
<tr> designating a table row
<th> saying these are the individual table headers, in order
<tbody> designating the contents of the table
<tr> again for individual table rows
<td> is for table data, to fill out the contents of the tables
<tfoot> is for the table footers


FORMS

Forms are inputs where the user can type things in, choose from a selection, check a box, etc. Basically interact in some way
<form> and </form> tags are used to define what will go into our form
<label> & </label> designate the text for the form
<input type="> (no closing tag) tells what type of form it will be based on what attribute we assign (text, submit button, color picker, etc.)
<textarea> creates a bigger box that the user can type into and make bigger or smaller with their cursor

example: 

    <form action="mailto:fakeemail@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
      <label>Your Name:</label>
      <input type="text" name="yourName" value=""><br>
      <label>Your Email:</label>
      <input type="email" name="yourEmail" value=""><br>
      <label>Your Message:</label><br>
      <textarea name="yourMessage" rows="10" cols="30"></textarea><br>
      <input type="submit" name="">
    </form>
    
    
the form action designates what submitting the form will do (in this case it will take the values in the name, email, and message boxes and try to email them to the fakeemail@gmail.com. But it could also be something like redirecting to another page.
enctype tells the form that the text is normal text so the corresponding email doesn't come up with any weird characters
when I have a button like a submit button, take out the (value"") section, because it's a button and has no value
