TABLES

When creating tables, the general structure will look like this:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dates</th>
        <th>Work</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2018 - 2021</td>
      <td>Arrow Electronics</td>
    </tr>
      <td>2021 - 2022</td>
      <td>Zayo Group</td>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
      
    </tfoot>

  </table>

it starts with <table> which designates that the data code & data will go there
tables headers and individual rows are then added one at a time
<thead> designating that this row will be for the table's headers
<tr> designating a table row
<th> saying these are the individual table headers, in order
<tbody> designating the contents of the table
<tr> again for individual table rows
<td> is for table data, to fill out the contents of the tables
<tfoot> is for the table footers
